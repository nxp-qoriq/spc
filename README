This package is a source code for Soft Parser Configuration tool.

The Soft Parser Configuration tool is a software package whose primary
purpose is converting NetPDL protocol descriptions of
custom protocols into hardware configuration. The tool provides an
abstraction layer between the end customer's vision of the NetPDL definition
and real hardware implementation.
Trying to achieve this aim, the tool frees customers from the need to learn new
hardware implementations details, gives a quick start for new customers
and simplifies the work for experienced users. In addition, the tool can be used
for hardware verification, permitting a wide range of input parameters
in fast and convenient form.
